Task 3

**Task 3A is a relatively simple task designed just for you to get comfortable with the usage of ROS2**

_Let's directly jump onto the **Problem Statement** without wasting any time (we have a deadline to catch!)._

## Problem Statement
Create a simple controller for turtlesim using python and use it to perform the desired maneuver.
### Task 3A
There are two things that need to be done:
* Draw an infinity sign using the turtle.
* The turtle must stop as it completes the shape.
The final output/drawing should resemble the appearance of a âˆž.

The expected output for Task 3A is given below ðŸ‘‡ :

### Bonus Task 3A
This is the follow on task of Task-3 which uses two turtles. (Hint : Checkout the services.)

The expected output for Bonus Task 3A is given below ðŸ‘‡ :

### Task 3B
Again Using the turtlesim turtle Implement a goal algorithm using p controller and go to the goals to the following coordinates:

**[[1.5,8.5], [8.5, 1.5], [5.197,5.197], [8.5, 8.5], [1.5,1.5], [5.197,5.197]].**

### Task 3C
Create a service that returns the fibonacci series of a given nonnegative integer when invoked.
